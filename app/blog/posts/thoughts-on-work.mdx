summary: 'I might be right. I might be wrong. But I know this is just a beginning'

Last month, my company underwent significant layoffs, and I found myself caught up in the shuffle. 
I say "caught up" because, as luck would have it, another employer extended an offer just as my old company was letting me go.

It was a sobering experience. I had witnessed colleagues dedicating two decades or more to our company, 
and I had envisioned myself following a similar path, assuming I'd always have a place there.

Yet, reality struck hard. In the blink of an eye, I transitioned—laid off by one company and swiftly hired by another. 
While I was grateful to retain employment, the loss of my former coworkers hit me profoundly.

It was a wake-up call, a reminder that complacency is a luxury I can no longer afford. 
I must actively invest in my skills: tackling LeetCode problems, pursuing AWS certifications, enrolling in online courses, 
contributing to open-source projects, and writing more code. Constant growth and adaptation are essential—preparing me for 
whatever twists the future may hold.

A hard pill to swallow. Admitting this truth is tough, but acceptance is the first step forward. 
It's time to turn the page and embrace the next chapter.
