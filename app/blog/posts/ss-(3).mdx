**AWS RDS**
-

1. install pgadmin 4 - <a href='https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/' target='_blank'> pgAdmin 4 (Windows)</a>

2. start RDS service 
3. connect to RDS server from pgadmin 4
4. Create table, column and rows
5. insert data

**Supabase**
-
1. Create Supabase account if you don't already have one
2. Create a new project
3. Enable pgvector 
    - Database
        ![Alt text](/images/semantic_search/ss3-1.png) 
    - Extension => search *vector* => toggle enable
        ![Alt text](/images/semantic_search/ss3-2.png) 
4. Create a table and columns
    ![Alt text](/images/semantic_search/ss3-3.png) 
    ***Note:*** *I disabled Row Level Security (RLS) just for my convenience. You can enable RLS later on as well*

    ***To Enable RLS:***
    1. Go to *Table Editor*, select your table and Click on *Add RLS policy*
    ![Alt text](/images/semantic_search/ss3-4.png) 
    2. Click on *Create policy*
    ![Alt text](/images/semantic_search/ss3-5.png) 
    3. search *insert* to get two options for pre-made insert policy (or you can type your own).
    ![Alt text](/images/semantic_search/ss3-6.png) 
        1`)` This policy allows any authenticated user to perform insert operations on the vector_table.

        2`)` You can use a service role key that has elevated privileges, bypassing RLS policies. 
        Ensure you keep this key secure and only use it in server-side code.
        
        Replace your current key with the service role key:
        ```
        key: str = 'your-service-role-key'
        ```

5. Insert Data

    Here is the Code: 
    ```py
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    import numpy as np
    from supabase import create_client, Client

    url: str = "your-supabase-url"
    key: str = "your-supabase-key"
    supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)

    model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L12-v2")

    query = "How big is London"

    query_embedding = model.encode(query)
    passage_embedding = model.encode([
        "London has 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census",
        "London is known for its finacial district",
    ])

    data, count = supabase.table('vector_table').insert({
        "query": query, "vector": query_embedding.tolist()
        }).execute()
    ```
    - Result: *id can be different*

**Firebase**
-
*As an alernative option for Supabase, Google announced that Firebase now supports SQL at Google I/O on May 14, 2024.
I don't know Firebase enough to compare it with AWS RDS and Supabase, so try Firebase at your own risk...*

1. Create Firebase Project
2. Do something with Data Connect...
