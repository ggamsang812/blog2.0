summary: 'Labor Day Weekend Here We Go'
---

This might be too late, but I found out I don't have my personal blog. And I want one. 
Since today is the start of the Labor Day weekend, I'll go ahead and make one next three days or so.
My only concern will be the design side of things... (I'm not very much gifted in art)

Out of all the frameworks and libraries out there to choose from, I'll just go ahead with React.js. 
It's been awhile since I've built something with React from the scratch. 
I can grab a template just to get it over with, but I probably won't.

I'll have to take a short online tutorials and read some documentations on React before I start though. 
Just to catch up on new features and updates.
