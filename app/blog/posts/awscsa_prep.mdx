I have heard that AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate and 
AWS Certified Developer - Associate share similar study materials to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner test.

Solutions Architect and Developer path are both quite interesting to me. To take my AWS skills to the next level, 
either one of those test will be a perfect fit for me. 

I'm aware of negative opinions regarding vendor licenses and how certificates don't represent 100% of skills 
that a certain engineer have. 
However, as for my view of current job market, I think if you're an engineer who wants to make transition in your career 
or get promoted from the current role, then those vendor license are better to have than nothing.

I just bought Neal Davis' Solutions Architect test prep package. Here wo go.
