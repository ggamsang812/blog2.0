Here is something that got me today working on 
<a href='https://github.com/ggamsang812/blog2.0' target='_blank'>blog2.0</a>.

When the following code is executed, how will the itemsArray appear? Sorted or unsorted? 
```jsx
//item.tsx
return (
    <>
      <testList allItems={itemsArray} />
      <div>
        {itemsArray.sort().map((item) => (
          <div></div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
```
 
```js
//testList.tsx
const mapItem = allItems.map((item) => (<div></div>))
```
Well, the answer can swing both ways. Here's why: The sequence of function calls in your code typically dictates 
their execution order. Factors such as asynchronicity, complexity, optimizations, and data dependencies can all 
influence the actual execution speed of each function. Consequently, it's vital to take these factors into account 
when scrutinizing your code's behavior and determining the execution order for various operations.

If the sort method is invoked first, in JavaScript, sort method will sorts the elements of the array in place and 
returns a reference to the sorted array. This means that the original array is directly modified; it doesn't 
generate a new array with the sorted elements. Consequently, any reference to the original array will now point to 
the sorted version.

However, if mapItem is called first, it will be mapped and sorted later.

Unless you're keen on diving into logging and debugging, the recommended practice here would be to sort first in 
the item.tsx if your intention is to ensure sorting occurs before any other operations.
```
//item.tsx
const sorteditems = itemsArray.sort()
return (
    <>
      <testList allItems={sorteditems} />
      <div>
        {sorteditems.map((item) => (
          <div></div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
```
