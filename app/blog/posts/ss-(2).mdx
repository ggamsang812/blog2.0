**0. Install Python 3.11**
-
   - Go here and install Python 3.11 : <a href='https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/' target='_blank'> Python 3.11.0</a>

**1. Install SentenceTransformers: <a href='https://sbert.net/docs/installation.html' target='_blank'> Installation Guide</a>**
-
    - Set your vscode interpreter setting to python 3.11
    ![Alt text](/images/semantic_search/ss2-3.png)
   - Install with pip

     `pip install -U sentence-transformers`

   - Install with conda

     `conda install -c conda-forge sentence-transformers`

   - Install from source

     `pip install -e . `

    - To use GPA / CUDA : <a href='https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/' target='_blank'>PyTorch - Get Started</a> 
-------------------
    ***Instead of switching interpreter setting on VSCode, you can also create/activate Virtual Environment by doing this instead:***
    - Create Virtual Environment:

        Navigate to your desired project directory in Command Prompt and create a virtual environment:
        ```C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe -m venv myenv```
    - Activate the virtual environment to ensure you're using the correct Python version:
        ```myenv\Scripts\activate```
    - Once the virtual environment is activated, install the sentence-transformers package:
        ```pip install -U sentence-transformers```
-------------------


**2. Choose the Pretrained Model: <a href='https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html' target='_blank'> sbert.net</a>**
-
    - I'll go with this model: <a href='https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2' target='_blank'>all-MiniLM-L12-v2</a>
    - You can search through the model, read through its description and choose your own model based on your need. 
    Just remember to change the model name in the codebase.
    
**3. Put this code to test if it's working:**
-
```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L12-v2")
query_embedding = model.encode("How big is London")
passage_embedding = model.encode([
    "London has 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census",
    "London is known for its finacial district",
])
print(query_embedding)
print("Similarity:", util.cos_sim(query_embedding, passage_embedding))
```
***explanation of the code:
First, loads / creates a SentenceTransformer model that can be used to map sentences / text to embeddings =>
Encode / Convert the string value to vector value => Calculates the Cosine similarity***

***I won't be using the cos_sim method from sentence_transformers later on. I'll be using pgvector***

 ***All models are hosted on the HuggingFace Model Hub.***


When you run it, it will first download the model to your system:

The output should look like this:
