Another error I had with Sentence Transformers was SSL Error when I try to download the pre-trained model. 

I did not capture the screenshot of error or log to copy from, but there was GitHub Issue related to this error which 
I also found the solution from: <a href='https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/issues/571' target='_blank'>GitHub Issue</a>

Downloading pre-trained model(s) from Sentence Transformers will require use of SSL and this SSL can cause an error depending on your SSL setting.

Massing around with SSL / TLS options of your device will be one solution, but here is the second option: 

## Download the model manually and put the model into the project
***This is the old way. The GitHub Issue I linked was from 2020 and, off course, we have a newer way... 
I decided to write another post on downloading the pre-trained model and putting it into the project mannually here:***

***This method from 2020 still works though!***

1) Go to this link: <a href='https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reimers/sentence-transformers/v0.2/' target='_blank'>Sentence Transformers Models</a>

2) Download the model you want to use. *I'll use "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"*  

3) Unzip the folder and move it to the project folder.

4) Import the Sentence Transformers, assign model_path value to the path of the model folder. 

    *You should be here at this point:*

5) Put below code to test embedding:
```
model = SentenceTransformer(model_path)
sentences = [
    "This framework generates embeddings for each input sentence",
    "Sentences are passed as a list of string.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
for sentence, embedding in zip(sentences, embeddings):
    print("Sentence:", sentence)
    print("Embedding:", embedding)
    print("")
```
The whole thing should look:

6) Run it. The result should look like this:
