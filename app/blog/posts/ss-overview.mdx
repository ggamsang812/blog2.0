I'll now be writing about how to implement similarity search in python. I wanted to show an overview of 
what I'm about to implement before I dive in.

First, here is the architecture diagram of similarity search from user input to finding the most similar data:

Also, here are the articles and links that I used to implement:

1) AWS Documentation on using pgvector on their Amazon RDS:

    1) <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/amazon-rds-postgresql-pgvector-ml-model-integration/?nc1=h_ls' target='_blank'>Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL now supports pgvector for simplified ML model integration</a>
    2) <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-ai-powered-search-in-postgresql-using-amazon-sagemaker-and-pgvector/' target='_blank'>Building AI-powered search in PostgreSQL using Amazon SageMaker and pgvector</a>
    3) <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/create-connect-postgresql-db/' target='_blank'>Create and Connect to a PostgreSQL Database with Amazon RDS</a>
    4) <a href='https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Extensions.html' target='_blank'>Using PostgreSQL extensions with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a>
    
2) I won't be using the content of this article, but it helped me understand the vector search: 
<a href='https://tembo.io/blog/sentence-transformers' target='_blank'>Automate vector search in Postgres with any Hugging Face transformer</a>


3) I'll be using different embedding model but most of the implementation will be very similar to this article: 
<a href='https://www.timescale.com/blog/postgresql-as-a-vector-database-create-store-and-query-openai-embeddings-with-pgvector/' target='_blank'>PostgreSQL as a Vector Database: A pgvector Tutorial</a>

For more information about the Sentence Transformers, check out my other posts:

***I won't be setting Sentence Transformers model directly to the project for this similarity search guide. 
However if you're facing SSL error or want to put model directly to the project, 
first link below will do.***
