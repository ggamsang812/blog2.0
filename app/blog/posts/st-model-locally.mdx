I found out my last post with guide to downloading and using pre-trained model is actually based on GitHub Issue from 2020.

Here is the new way (4/28/2024):

1) Decide which model you want to use:
    - Based on Performance? Speed? Model Size? Suitable Score Functions?
*Toggle "All Model" button to view from the all model* => 
    <a href='https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html' target='_blank'> sbert.net</a> 
    - Based on MTEB leaderboard? => <a href='https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard' target='_blank'> Massive Text Embedding Benchmark Leaderboard</a>

2) Whether you chose to go with sbert.net or MTEB Leaderboard, Click on the model name. 
It should take you to the Huggingface Model card.
*You do have to click through for sbert.net*
    1) Fron the sbert.net link above, scroll down a little and you should see the list of models. Click on your choice of model.
    I'll use the "paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2" model as an example : ![Alt text](/images/st-guide-new1.png)
    
    2) Once you click it, you should get a drop down expandable. Click the link by the Model card row.

    3) If you get to page that looks something like this, you're on the right track. ![Alt text](/images/st-guide-new3.png)

3) On the right side of the page there is a vertical three dot icon (I don't know what they're called...)

    1) *Click "Clone reposity"*![Alt text](/images/st-guide-new4.png)

    2) *You will get a pop up. Follow the first two, but clone it inside your project* ![Alt text](/images/st-guide-new5.png)

    3) *Result* ![Alt text](/images/st-guide-new7.png)

4) If you want to test, here is the code:
```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model_path = r"C:\Users\Lennie\Desktop\LgihtHouse\Python\AI\paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2"
model = SentenceTransformer(model_path)
sentences = [
    "This framework generates embeddings for each input sentence",
    "Sentences are passed as a list of string.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
for sentence, embedding in zip(sentences, embeddings):
    print("Sentence:", sentence)
    print("Embedding:", embedding)
    print("")
```
    1) It should look like this:
