If your choice for embedding model is Sentence Transformers, then you might face a few error related to Sentence Transformers. 

One error I faced was "OSError: [WinError 126] The specified module could not be found."

There might be a long lines of error log but somewhere in the log you'll have this log:
![Alt text](/images/st-torch-screenshot.png)
```
Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "PATH\AI\st_test.py", line 2, in <module>
    import torch
  File "PATH\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\torch\__init__.py", line 141, in <module>
    raise err
OSError: [WinError 126] The specified module could not be found. 
Error loading "PATH\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\torch\lib\shm.dll" or one of its dependencies.
```

Two potential problems here:

## 1. Running on Python 3.12?
- Sentence Transformers requires PyTorch and PyTorch does not support python 3.12 yet and it only runs on python 3.11 (as of 4/27/2024).

- You will need to download Python 3.11 and do either :
    1. Reinstall Sentence Transformers. This will install the PyTorch for you again. 
    2. Set up an virtual evironment with Python 3.11 version and then install Sentence Transformers in the virtual evironment.

## 2. Try to Reinstall the PyTorch Seperatly
- It might be a good idea to reinstall the PyTorch seperatly
- Simply uninstall and reinstall the PyTorch.
- Don't forget that installation commend differs depending on whether you want the PyTorch to run on CPU or GPU. 
- I personally reinstalled the Sentence Transformers again after installing the PyTorch seperatly.

### To install the PyTorch: 
    1) (For GPU) run `nvcc --version` first to check CUDA version. If `nvcc : The term 'nvcc' is not recognized as the name of a cmdle` pops up,
    you probably don't have GPU in the system and will need to install PyTorch for CPU. 
    2) <a href='https://pytorch.org/' target='_blank'>Go to PyTorch WebSite</a>
    3) Scroll down, find this selection part and select your build and system. It will tell you which command to run beside "Run this Command" 
    
        This was my case:

    4) If you want to check if the PyTorch has been installed or not. 

        Run this Python script:
    ```
    import torch
    print(torch.__version__)
    ```     
    5) You are all set, if you get a PyTorch version printed out.
