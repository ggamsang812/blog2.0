Alright.

I completed an AWS online course by January 31st, and I've since attempted eight practice exams for 
the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. Unfortunately, I failed each one by a significant margin.

The root of the issue lies in my slow reading pace. While I manage to answer most questions correctly, 
I simply cannot process all the exam questions within the allotted time.

I'm not throwing in the towel on this certification just yet, but I recognize the need to enhance my 
English reading skills before attempting the exam again. For now, I'll hit pause on my AWS studies and related activities.

However, I've been assigned to a Gen AI project at work that utilizes AWS services, 
so I'll still be immersed in AWS-related work, which should keep me up to date without the pressure of certification exams.
